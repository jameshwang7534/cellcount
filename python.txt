Python 2.b:

b_cell: p-value = 0.1775
cd8_t_cell: p-value = 0.5209
cd4_t_cell: p-value = 0.0104
nk_cell: p-value = 0.0821
monocyte: p-value = 0.0210

Among the five immune cell populations, cd4_t_cell and monocyte show statistically significant differences 
in relative frequencies between responders and non-responders (p-values of 0.0104 and 0.0210, respectively), 
suggesting they may be associated with treatment response.
