1. To organize the data, I’d use a database with separate tables for projects, patients, samples, and cell counts. 
Each project would have its own ID and name. Patients (called subjects) would be linked to a project and have info 
like age, sex, and disease type.

Each sample would be linked to a patient and would include details like sample type (for example, PBMC), treatment (like tr1), response (yes or no), and when the sample was taken. 
The actual immune cell data (like b_cell, cd4_t_cell, etc.) would go into a cell counts table, which would include both the number of cells and the percentage for each population.

2. Using a database makes it easier to organize and manage large amounts of data. It helps keep everything consistent, like linking each sample to the right patient. 
You can also quickly search and analyze the data using queries, which saves time. It’s better than using spreadsheets, especially when working with many projects or people.
